What is this?
=================
This is primarily where I keep all my backend stuff for learning new concepts. You may review or use the code if you want.

### But wait... there's more!
>I can't keep everything in Github.. no, that would be ridiculous. Somethings are meant to be interactive, playful, or artistic. Some of where I store my frontend shenanigans are listed on the table below.

| Other Repositories        | What to expect from the repository           |
